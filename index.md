# About


A game made by Raccoon Hands Productions, an immersive learning class at Ball State University. Our goal was to produce a game that focused on cooperative game play while building player interest in the collaborative food preservation process. *Canning Season* is designed to played on connected tablets. Each tablet will be a different "station" where players will perform different tasks to help preserve carrots in Ball Jars.
