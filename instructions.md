# Installation and Operation Instructions

## Hardware Requirements

This project requires at least three Android devices, preferably tablets.
It also requires operating on a Wi-Fi network that allows devices
to communicate with each other. This is normal on a home network, for example,
but business or university networks may be configured to prevent this.

## Installation Instructions

1. Visit [the project releases page](https://github.com/RaccoonHandsProductions/CanningSeason/releases) from the tablets on which you wish to install the game.

1. Under &ldquo;Assets,&rdquo; tap `CanningSeason.apk` to download the application.

1. Approve the download and installation of the project from the APK file. 
   You may receive a message about it being unsigned and potentially harmful;
   this is expected behavior, and the warning can be disregarded. 

## Setting Up Network Multiplayer

1. Select one tablet to the the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Create a server.&rdquo;
At the top of the tablet, it should now have an IP address at the top.
This series of four numbers, separated by periods, is important for Step 3.

2. Go through every other tablet and select &ldquo;Join a Server.&rdquo;

3. Now input the IP address displayed on the Host as explained in Step 1.

4. Once complete, the Host tablet will prompt you with the option to start the game.

Now you are ready to play!
